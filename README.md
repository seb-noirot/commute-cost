# Commute Cost Visualizer with ChatGPT Assistance

## Overview
This project provides a visual representation of the cost implications of commuting, using simple HTML and JavaScript functionalities. The development and feature ideation were executed with guidance from OpenAI's ChatGPT. Notably, I didn't write or modify any part of the code manually; the entire process was facilitated through AI assistance.

## Features
1. **Input Form**: Users can input the following parameters:
    - Commute cost (e.g., bus ticket price).
    - Commute time in minutes.
    - Hourly salary.
    - Frequency of commuting per week.
    - Weeks worked per year.
    - Preferred currency for cost representation.

2. **Local Storage**: The application saves user input values to the browser's local storage. When the page is revisited, previously entered values are automatically loaded.

3. **Bar & Line Chart Representation**: Uses Chart.js to showcase:
    - Ticket costs for commuting.
    - Time lost costs.
    - Total hours lost due to commuting.

4. **Interactive Tooltip**: On hovering over any data point on the x-axis, a custom tooltip displays a breakdown of costs and hours lost.

## Development & Testing with ChatGPT
The application's development phase exclusively utilized ChatGPT for brainstorming, troubleshooting, and coding. This interactive approach allowed for dynamic adjustments based on feedback loops and real-time suggestions from the AI, without manual code interventions on my part.

## Setup & Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Fill in the form with your commute parameters.
4. View the chart that's generated based on the entered values.
5. Hover over data points to view a detailed breakdown of costs and hours lost.

## Conclusion
This project serves as evidence of the potential and efficiency of ChatGPT in handling web development tasks from inception to completion without the need for manual code edits.
